This was started with AdvantageKit 4.0.0 swerve template.
Added to it the tunerconstants.java generated by CTRE TunerX swerve wizard that was run on 2024 comp bot.
This was proven to be able to drive the 2024 comp bot.
PathPlanner was used to generate paths on left, middle and right.  They run properly on blue and red.
Additional paths in on auton were generated to go from reef to source and back.
